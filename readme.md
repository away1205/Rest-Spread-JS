In JavaScript, both the rest and spread operators are used to work with arrays and objects, but they serve different purposes.

Rest Operator:
The rest operator, represented by the ellipsis (`...`), allows you to capture multiple elements of an array or object and group them into a new array or object. It is primarily used in function parameters or array destructuring.

Example with arrays:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const [first, second, ...rest] = numbers;
console.log(first); // 1
console.log(second); // 2
console.log(rest); // [3, 4, 5]
```
In this example, the rest operator (`...rest`) collects the remaining elements of the `numbers` array after the first two elements are assigned to `first` and `second` variables.

Example with objects:
```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  city: 'New York',
  country: 'USA',
};

const { name, age, ...rest } = person;
console.log(name); // 'John'
console.log(age); // 30
console.log(rest); // { city: 'New York', country: 'USA' }
```
Here, the rest operator collects the remaining properties of the `person` object after `name` and `age` properties are extracted.

Spread Operator:
The spread operator, also represented by the ellipsis (`...`), is used to expand an array or object into individual elements. It allows you to create a copy of an array or object or combine multiple arrays or objects together.

Example with arrays:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const moreNumbers = [4, 5, 6];

const combined = [...numbers, ...moreNumbers];
console.log(combined); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
In this example, the spread operator expands the `numbers` and `moreNumbers` arrays and combines them into a new `combined` array.

Example with objects:
```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
};

const updatedPerson = {
  ...person,
  city: 'New York',
};
console.log(updatedPerson);
// { name: 'John', age: 30, city: 'New York' }
```
Here, the spread operator expands the `person` object, creating a new `updatedPerson` object with the additional `city` property.

In summary, the rest operator collects elements into an array or object, while the spread operator expands an array or object into individual elements. The rest operator is mainly used in function parameters or array destructuring, while the spread operator is used for creating copies or merging arrays/objects.
